Dear Hiring Team,

This is regarding the Banking Technology and Operations faculty position in the School of Information Systems at SMU

The near collapse of Knight Capital in 2012 due to an IT operational error, highlights the criticality of IT and Operations. On my  12 years in professional IT banking career, including Morgan-Stanley, UBS and Lehman Brothers, I have observed similar events that have affected my approach on design, implementation and management of T&O systems.

My professional roles with architecture, software development and management of different IT systems have given me exposure to the back, middle and front office banking sections, gaining a deeper understanding of each section's IT systems and operational processes. This knowledge would help me in developing teaching material as well as provide insights and real world scenarios in financial services technology.

Liaising with trading desks and senior management in IT, operations and compliance departments has helped me developed skills to present, promote and involve stakeholders for various technology and operational initiatives. These skills could be used at SMU to engage industry leaders through presentations and seminars as this position requires.

On the personal side, I am an avid reader, enjoy mentoring, and making complex concepts more accessible. My intellectual curiosity drives me to explore and keep up with innovation in Technology and Finance. 

I will be in Singapore in March and would appreciate an opportunity to meet and discuss the position in more detail.
