Dear Mr. Chng,

This is regarding the Banking Technology and Operations faculty position in the School of Information Systems at SMU

The near collapse of Knight Capital in 2012 due to an IT operational error, highlights the criticality of IT and Operations. On my  12 years in professional IT banking career, including Morgan-Stanley, UBS and Lehman Brothers, I have observed similar events that have affected my approach on design, implementation and management of T&O systems.

My professional roles architecting and managing different IT systems have given me exposure to the back, mid and front office banking sections which required shifting of focus and priorities: regulatory and risk control for back and mid office and rapid tools for trading and sales teams. 

This exposure has helped in getting a deeper understanding of the different banking sub-organizations, their systems and operational processes. This knowledge can be incorporated into banking technology teaching material as well as used to give real world scenarios and insights to prospective T&O professional at SMU.

In addition to technical planning and design involving analytic and software teams my responsibilities required liaising with trading desks and senior management in IT, operations and compliance departments. This involvement has helped in developing skills to present, promote and engage stakeholders for various technology and operational initiatives. These skills could be utilized beyond the classrooms to engage industry leaders through presentations and seminars that this position requires.

On the personal side, I am an avid reader, enjoy mentoring, and making complex concepts more accessible. My intellectual curiosity drives me to explore and keep up with innovation in Technology and Finance. 

I am confident that my educational background, professional experience and personal traits would add value to SMU and give me an opportunity to impact students to be well quipped in the T&O banking sectors.
